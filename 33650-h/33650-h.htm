<h2>Article XLI.&mdash;NEW WEST INDIAN SPIDERS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Nathan Banks.</span></h3>


<p>The following new species were found in the course of an examination of
material in the American Museum of Natural History collected by Dr. F.
E. Lutz and Mr. Charles W. Leng in Cuba and by Dr. Lutz in Porto Rico.
The types are in that institution.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Mecol&oelig;sthus signatus</b> n. sp.</p>

<p>Cephalothorax pale, with black median mark, wider at head; sternum
reddish or yellowish. Abdomen pale, with a black median stripe, narrowed
near middle, not reaching anterior end where there is an oblique stripe,
and a basal spot each side, also an apical spot each side, and the basal
pleura show an oblique dark stripe. These marks are made up of small
spots, more or less connected. The venter shows a narrow, median black
stripe followed by a round spot, some distance before the spinnerets.
Femora reddish, blackish near tip, and a white band at extreme tip;
tibi&aelig; dark, with a broad, white band near tip; rest of legs paler. Eyes
in two groups, three each side (subequal in size) on a distinct
elevation; A. M. E. minute, close together, and as high as upper edge of

long; vulval area corneous, yellow, concave behind, but little swollen.

<p class="center"><b>Wulfila pretiosa</b> n. sp.</p>

<p>Pale yellowish. Cephalothorax with a greenish stripe each side, a
greenish mark over groove, and two faint lines back from P. M. E.;
mandibles with a greenish vertical line in middle. Abdomen with dark
greenish or nearly blackish stripe each side reaching to middle, a spot
behind it, and a large median spot above spinnerets, four small dark
dots in mid-dorsum; legs with faint dark spots at bases of many spines
on femora and tibi&aelig;. Cephalothorax narrow in front, A. M. E. hardly more
than diameter apart; about as close to the very much larger A. S. E.

E., P. M. E. about two diameters apart, and about as far from P. S. E.
Legs long and slender, first and fourth pair about equal, all with stout
spines on femora; tibi&aelig; and metatarsi I and II each with two pairs of
very long spines, none at tips. The black hair on tips of maxill&aelig;, lip
and mandibles is very prominent. Abdomen twice as long as broad. Length
4.5 mm.; leg I, 8 mm.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Wulfila immaculata</b> n. sp.</p>

<p>White or pale yellowish throughout, unmarked; the eyes on black rings,
the claws black, and the anterior edge of the vulva reddish. The A. M.
E. small, but little more than their diameter apart, about twice as far
from the plainly large A. S. E., P. M. E. nearly three diameters apart,

mandibles dull yellowish. Legs pale yellowish, femora and cox&aelig; more
whitish, tibi&aelig; and patell&aelig; I and IV tipped with black. Sternum
yellowish, margined with dark. Abdomen above gray, with scattered white
spots and larger black patches; a basal black spot each side, and two
others each side toward tip, the last larger and extending down on sides
to near the spinnerets; a large, oblique, dark spot on pleura, and one
near base; venter with a large, median blackish spot, concave in front,
dark on sides of genital groove. Legs I and II very long, much longer
than others, all with many long, fine but stiff, hairs and some erect
bristles on tibi&aelig;, a long one at top of each patella above and one near
middle of tibia above. Length 1.8 mm.</p>

sometimes metatarsi, slightly infuscated; sternum sometimes more
yellowish, no markings. Abdomen white above and below. Eyes small;
posterior row recurved, subequal in size, the P. M. E. one half nearer
to each other than to the S. E. and about three diameters apart; the
four M. E. make a square; A. S. E. smaller than other eyes, close to P.
S. E., fully as far from A. M. E. as these from each other. Legs with
many fine white bristles, and a few black spines, two on inner side of

metatarsus I about as long as tibia plus patella I. Sternum
sub-triangular, a little longer than broad, pointed behind. Abdomen
fully one and a half times longer than broad, roundedly projecting
behind the spinnerets, no higher at base than at spinnerets, and
broadest at about middle of length. Length 3 mm.</p>

<p>From 12-1/2 kilometers south of Pinar del Rio, Cuba. September. No.

<p class="center"><b>Misumessus echinatus</b> n. sp.</p>

<p>Male: Cephalothorax yellowish, with about fifty small reddish-brown
spots scattered over surface, from each of which arises a short, but
very stout spine; the marginal seam is reddish. The legs are pale with
spots similar to those on the cephalothorax, many of which have a
bristle or spine; no marks on the tarsi, but tibi&aelig; and metatarsis are
twice banded with reddish. The cox&aelig; and sternum are pale. The abdomen is
rather whitish above, with two rows of five reddish spots near middle,
and elsewhere with many reddish dots, from many of which arise short,
stout spines like those on the cephalothorax, pleura with red spots;
venter with two reddish marks near base, beyond genital furrow with
transverse white and black spots; some red around the pale spinnerets.
The A. S. E. rather larger than usual; P. M. E. about three diameters
apart, about as close to the P. S. E. Legs long and slender, tibia I

about as far from the somewhat smaller A. S. E.; P. S. E. equal to A. S.
E., P. M. E. much smaller than A. M. E., fully two and one half
diameters apart and as far from the slightly larger P. S. E. Male palpi
